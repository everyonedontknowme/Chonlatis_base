# Where is ESX?

2020-04-22 we recieved an email from GitHub stating that kanersps had started a DMCA takedown notice against monster_base. https://pastebin.com/kKxwH7MS

In his initial notice he is saying that multiple files in ESX belong to him and he would like to be credited for everything he has done. He doesn't link the exact files that he claim he owns, just a link to our repo. This means that he wants the entire repo removed if we don't credit him for his code.

He is butthurt over how when we ditched essentialmode we created functions and other things that did what essentialmode did... But how do you expect us to ditch essentialmode if we cannot create our own command handling code? We can't. He claims in his second DMCA takedown notice https://pastebin.com/2q5cVHYS that our code is "stolen" from his project.
As I just said it's impossible to go standalone if we don't create the features essentialmode had to offer, command handling is a perfect example, and as you can imaine the code differences aren't huge.

He also mentions how his code is licensed under AGPLv3, and that ESX must also be licensed under the same. But this is false, ESX was developed around 2017 initially, (old time when it used essentialmode). What license was essentialmode on at that time you wonder? Good question, web archive has archived his old website, where it's clearly a nolicense license. http://web.archive.org/web/20180516175223/https://docs.essentialmode.com/#license

Gizz told me not to make an announcement, sorry mate. He has also said that we are in a modding community where the fivem devs are REVERSING a whole copyrighted game for us, meanwhile kanersps is spending time on a DMCA takedown to ruin the community.

Kanersps obviously have a weird intention we can't identify. Is it to destabilise ESX to tell everyone to move to extendedmode? And if so does the contributors of that project have anything to do with this? Is it to revenge on his shitty framework being ditched? Is it just to be a asshole? Maybe even the fivem developers are a part of it?

We don't know, and don't really know how GitHub are handling this DMCA takedown notice. I mean how can they take a takedown notice that don't even specify what files are infringing seriously? Some files in the ESX project, such as the server sided player class file might need a rewrite, in the meantime if required then we will remove that file and create our own from scratch.

TLDR monster got taken down by kanersps (invalidly, we are going to get justice) because he is sad we ditched him
